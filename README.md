I am using the NASA Near Earth Object Web Service API. This site is supposed to allow the user to easily look through the data since 1900 and present the Near Earth Objects on the days of their close approaches. Each object is populated with information that the website is supposed to make it easier to sort through. 

Right now it is by no means perfect, but the basic job of pulling up a day's worth of information to compare to each other is being accomplished. I will keep this project going on the back burner as a good way to practice my development skills with a large database. There are other public resources to map the data and such that would be very informative to explore. As well as just the more basic functions as sorting through multiple days at a time. 

The goal should remain for users to easily interact with the data and choose how it is displayed.

Contains
An HTML file that is the basic body of the site though it relies heavily on the JavaScript to be populated.

A JavaScript file that is key to accessing the data and is reliant on functions to populate the window. Not perfectly cleaned up as I have ideas I would still like to pursue or close off before I remove the code.

A CSS file that is bare bones but doing what I would like it to do for the moment. I had some ideas for some more iamges but with the time limit I was happy to focus on the core deliverables of interacting with a database and the DOM through eventListeners.
