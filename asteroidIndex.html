        <p id="near-earth-object-description">Near Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids or comets whose orbital paths come close with Earth's.
            <br>
            The following are all of the Near Earth Objects recorded by NASA during your selected date range. The date refers to an asteroid's closest passage to Earth.
        </p>
        <p id='doom-mongering-quote'>"Of the more than 700,000 known asteroids in our Solar System, about 17,000 are known to be NEOs. [...] On February 15, 2013, when an unknown object traveling at 66,000 km/h and thought to be 17–20 m in diameter exploded high above Chelyabinsk, Russia, with 20–30 times the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The resulting shock wave caused widespread damage and injuries, making it the largest known natural object to have entered Earth's atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event, which destroyed a remote forest area of Siberia. NEO collisions therefore represent a major threat both to humans and to planetary environments."<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/near-earth-objects#B978032390226700009X-s0130">(1)</a>.</p>
